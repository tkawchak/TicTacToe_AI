#TicTacToe Program

This is a Tic Tac Toe program that will play against you with an AI.  This is written in C++ with no dependencies besides the standard libraries and uses minimas decision trees combined with some modified pruning to determine subsequent moves.

Feel free to download this and to share it with others.  Additionally, share any bugs, suggestions, and comments with me.  Thanks!

#Possible Improvements (not necessarily in order):
* [Add a GUI to facilitate better usability
* [Create option to have CPU start or user make first move
